# Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset's characteristics and visualize relationships between features.
- Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots are used to identify patterns and insights.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- This ensures that the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

### 3. Model Training
- Several machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed data.
- RandomForestClassifier is chosen as the primary model due to its versatility and robustness.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- The trained models are evaluated using accuracy metrics on a test dataset.
- GridSearchCV is employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 5. Final Model Deployment
- The best-performing model is selected for deployment.
- Test data is preprocessed, and predictions are made on unseen data to assess the model's generalization ability.
